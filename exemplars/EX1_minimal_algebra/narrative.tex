\paragraph{Purpose.}
This exemplar instantiates a tiny finite Systemics theory to exercise the core alignment story:
relational kernels, sequential composition induced by a composition kit, and a mechanically computed
trace table for a composed pipeline.

\paragraph{Scope.}
This is intentionally minimal: it demonstrates the \emph{algebraic spine} (composition + witnesses) without enrichments.
