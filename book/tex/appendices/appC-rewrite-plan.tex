\label{sec:appC-rewrite-plan}

\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=*, itemsep=0.25em]
  \item Extract shared prelims (universes, traces, contracts, canonicalization kit) into Part I.
  \item Move $\Sigma 2$ conformance preservation into Part II (Chapter 6).
  \item Move $\Sigma 1$ execution/replay/verify into Part III (Chapters 7--8).
  \item Move $\Sigma 3$ equivalence + rewriting into Part III/IV (Chapters 9--11).
  \item Move $\Sigma 4$ stability into Part V (Chapter 12) as a contract enrichment.
  \item Move $\Sigma 5$ capacity into Part V (Chapter 13) as feasibility enrichment.
  \item Move $\Sigma 6$ evidence into Part V (Chapter 14) as proof-relevant enrichment.
  \item Reframe EX1--EX3 as Part VI, each explicitly pointing back to theorems and axioms used.
\end{enumerate}
